### Container Image
- A container is image is lightweight, standalone package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including code, runtime, system tools and libraries.
- Containers is an running instance of an image.
- We can have many containers running the same image.

### Why containers required
- Containers are required for efficient and consistent application deployment and management, ensuring portablility and scalability accorss different environments.

### How containers are different from VMs
- Containers and VMs both have similar resource allocation and allocation benifits.
- Containers and VMs are functionally different because containers virtualise the OS and VMs are virtualise the hardware.
- Containers are more portable which means containers can deploy from one place to another or create multiple instance of containers in same or another instance.
